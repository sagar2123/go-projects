## Twosum function

This function takes in a list of numbers (`nums`) and a target number (`target`) as input and returns a boolean value based on whether there are two numbers in the list that add up to the target.

### Parameters
- `nums`: A list of integers in which we need to find two numbers that sum up to the target.
- `target`: The target sum that we are looking for.

### Output
- `true`: If there are two numbers in the list that add up to the target.
- `false`: If there are no two numbers in the list that add up to the target.

### Usage
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	nums := []int{2, 7, 11, 15}
	target := 9
	result := Twosum(nums, target)
	fmt.Println(result) // Output: true
}
```

### Example
If we have the input `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`, the function should return `true` because `2 + 7 = 9`.
